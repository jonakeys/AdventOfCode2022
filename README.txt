In this repository I place my solutions to the programming puzzles on the Advent Of Code 2022
https://adventofcode.com/2022

I'm a hobby amateur programmer so please forgive me if I'm not using the most efficient and/or elegant way of solving the problems.

I have a lot of fun solving the puzzles, training and extending my skills.
